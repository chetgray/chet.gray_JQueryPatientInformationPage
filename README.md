>   information. The page should have:
>   - [ ] Permanent Section - Heading, "General Patient Information"
>     - [ ] Patient Name, Address, and Date of Birth
>     - [ ] Patient Address
>     - [ ] Patient Primary Phone
>   - [ ] Optional Section - show if the user clicks a box that says, "Patient has
>     Primary Insurance." Heading - "Primary Insurance"
>     - [ ] Insurance Company
>     - [ ] Plan ID
>     - [ ] Group Code
>   - [ ] Optional Section - show if the user clicks a box that says, "Patient has
>     Secondary Insurance." Heading - "Secondary Insurance"
>     - [ ] Insurance Company
>     - [ ] Plan ID
>     - [ ] Group Code
>   - [ ] Optional Section - show if the user clicks a box that says, "Patient opts-in
>     for text alerts." Heading - "Text Alert Information"
>     - [ ] Mobile Number
>     - [ ] Mobile Carrier
>     - [ ] A note that "Data charges may apply."
>   - [ ] A Submit button
>   - [ ] When the Submit button is clicked, send an alert pop-up that says,
>     "Information for (Patient Name) submitted successfully." Clear all the fields to
>     get ready for the next entry. Uncheck all the checkboxes. Hide all the stuff that
>     should be hidden.
>   - [ ] Important thing to consider: A patient cannot have Secondary Insurance unless
>     they have Primary Insurance. So if the user has checked both, and they uncheck
>     Primary, you need to hide Secondary as well. Fun!
